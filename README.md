## Local Preview

If opening `index.html` directly in a browser you might see blocked scripts or missing content. Start a small development server and open the page via `http://localhost` instead:

```bash
python3 serve.py
```

The script uses Python's builtâ€‘in `http.server` module and serves the site on port `8000`. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to preview the application.
