# 🎯 CRITICAL FIREBASE CONFIGURATION FIX

## ❌ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The applications were not appearing in the main table because there was a **Firebase project configuration mismatch**:

### Before Fix:
- **Main Application (index.html, main.js)**: Connected to project `aplikacje-3068f`
- **Add Application (add-application.js)**: Connected to project `rekrutracker-app`

This meant:
- ✅ New applications were successfully saved to Firebase
- ❌ But they were saved to `rekrutracker-app` project
- ❌ Main app was looking for applications in `aplikacje-3068f` project
- ❌ Real-time listener was working correctly but listening to the wrong database

## ✅ SOLUTION APPLIED

### Files Updated:
1. **`/add-application.js`** - Updated Firebase config to match main app
2. **`/firebase-init.js`** - Updated shared Firebase config

### New Configuration (All Files):
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyD7ZLyDHFBNsQe9j03YPi0xmdLbqdk_K68",
    authDomain: "rekrutracker-app.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "rekrutracker-app",
    storageBucket: "rekrutracker-app.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "758407291898",
    appId: "1:758407291898:web:a573e2cd3b416596d37a43",
    measurementId: "G-HQW1YLG9Q1"
};
```

## 🧪 TESTING PROCEDURE

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) to ensure fresh Firebase connections
2. **Log in** to the main application
3. **Add a new application** using the add-application.html page
4. **Verify** that the application appears immediately in the main table

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS

After this fix:
- ✅ New applications will be saved to the correct Firebase project
- ✅ Real-time listener will receive updates immediately
- ✅ Applications will appear in the main table without page refresh
- ✅ All existing functionality (filters, sorting, editing) will work correctly

## 🔍 WHY THIS WASN'T CAUGHT EARLIER

1. Both Firebase projects existed and were functional
2. Form submission appeared successful (it was - just to wrong database)
3. No JavaScript errors occurred
4. The issue only became apparent when data didn't sync between pages

## 🚀 STATUS: READY FOR TESTING

The Firebase configuration is now unified across all application components. The real-time listener and all other features implemented earlier will now work correctly since they're all connected to the same database.

**Test by adding a new application - it should appear immediately in the main table!**
